	abstract = {Transcription factor ({TF}) databases contain multitudes of binding motifs ({TFBMs}) from various sources, from which non-redundant collections are derived by manual curation. The advent of high-throughput methods stimulated the production of novel collections with increasing numbers of motifs. Meta-databases, built by merging these collections, contain redundant versions, because available tools are not suited to automatically identify and explore biologically relevant clusters among thousands of motifs. Motif discovery from genome-scale data sets (e.g. {ChIP}-seq) also produces redundant motifs, hampering the interpretation of results. We present matrix-clustering, a versatile tool that clusters similar {TFBMs} into multiple trees, and automatically creates non-redundant {TFBM} collections. A feature unique to matrix-clustering is its dynamic visualisation of aligned {TFBMs}, and its capability to simultaneously treat multiple collections from various sources. We demonstrate that matrix-clustering considerably simplifies the interpretation of combined results from multiple motif discovery tools, and highlights biologically relevant variations of similar motifs. We also ran a large-scale application to cluster ∼11 000 motifs from 24 entire databases, showing that matrix-clustering correctly groups motifs belonging to the same {TF} families, and drastically reduced motif redundancy. matrix-clustering is integrated within the {RSAT} suite (http://rsat.eu/), accessible through a user-friendly web interface or command-line for its integration in pipelines.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing ({AS}) is a fundamental mechanism that regulates gene expressionin both physiological and pathological processes. This article introduces {ASTK}, a software package covering upstream and downstream analysis of {AS}. Initially, {ASTK} offers a module to perform enrichment analysis at both the gene- and exon-level to incorporate various impacts by different spliced events on a single gene. We further cluster {AS} genes and alternative exons into three groups based on spliced exon sizes (micro-, mid-, and macro-), which are preferentially associated with distinct biological pathways. A major challenge in the field has been decoding the regulatory codes of splicing. {ASTK} adeptly extracts both sequence features and epigenetic marks associated with {AS} events. Through the application of machine learning algorithms, we identified pivotal features influencing the inclusion levels of most {AS} types. Notably, the splice site strength is a primary determinant for the inclusion levels in alternative 3’/5’ splice sites (A3/A5). For the alternative first exon and skipping exon classes, a combination of sequence and epigenetic features collaboratively dictate exon inclusion/exclusion. Our findings underscore {ASTK}'s capability to enhance the functional understanding of {AS} events and shed light on the intricacies of splicing regulation.},

The regulatory relationship between transcription factors ({TFs}), key regulators of gene expression, and their target genes, the so called {TF} regulons, can be coupled with computational algorithms to estimate the activity of {TFs}. However, to interpret these findings accurately, regulons of high reliability and coverage are needed. In this study, we present and evaluate a collection of regulons created using the {CollecTRI} meta-resource containing signed {TF}–gene interactions for 1186 {TFs}. In this context, we introduce a workflow to integrate information from multiple resources and assign the sign of regulation to {TF}–gene interactions that could be applied to other comprehensive knowledge bases. We find that the signed {CollecTRI}-derived regulons outperform other public collections of regulatory interactions in accurately inferring changes in {TF} activities in perturbation experiments. Furthermore, we showcase the value of the regulons by examining {TF} activity profiles in three different cancer types and exploring {TF} activities at the level of single-cells. Overall, the {CollecTRI}-derived {TF} regulons enable the accurate and comprehensive estimation of {TF} activities and thereby help to interpret transcriptomics data.},

These locations serve as beacons for additional factors, exemplified by liver X receptors, which drive both cell-specific gene expression and signal-dependent responses. Together with analyses of transcription factor binding and H3K4me1 patterns in other cell types, these studies suggest that simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors can specify the genomic sites ultimately responsible for both cell identity and cell type-specific responses to diverse signaling inputs.},

The mechanisms governing pioneer factor occupancy and the relationship between chromatin occupancy and opening remain unclear. We studied three Drosophila transcription factors with distinct {DNA}-binding domains and biological functions: Zelda, Grainy head and Twist. We demonstrated that the level of chromatin occupancy is a key determinant of pioneering activity. Multiple factors regulate occupancy, including motif content, local chromatin and protein concentration. Regions outside the {DNA}-binding domain are required for binding and chromatin opening. Our results show that pioneering activity is not a binary feature intrinsic to a protein but occurs on a spectrum and is regulated by a variety of protein-intrinsic and cell-type-specific features.},

Current methods to map these interactions, such as {CLIP}, rely on purifying single proteins at a time. Our new method, {ePRINT}, maps {RBP}-{RNA} interaction networks on a global scale without purifying individual {RBPs}. {ePRINT} uses exoribonuclease {XRN}1 to precisely map the 5′ end of the {RBP} binding site and uncovers direct and indirect targets of an {RBP} of interest. Importantly, {ePRINT} can also uncover {RBPs} that are differentially activated between cell fate transitions, including neural progenitor differentiation into neurons.},

	abstract = {In some mammals, notably humans, recombination occurs almost exclusively where the protein {PRDM}9 binds, whereas in vertebrates lacking an intact {PRDM}9, such as birds and canids, recombination rates are elevated near promoter-like features. To determine whether {PRDM}9 directs recombination in nonmammalian vertebrates, we focused on an exemplar species with a single, intact {PRDM}9 ortholog, the corn snake (Pantherophis guttatus). Analyzing historical recombination rates along the genome and crossovers in pedigrees, we found evidence that {PRDM}9 specifies the location of recombination events, but we also detected a separable effect of promoter-like features. These findings reveal that the uses of {PRDM}9 and promoter-like features need not be mutually exclusive and instead reflect a tug-of-war that is more even in some species than others.},

	abstract = {Targeted engineering of plant gene expression holds great promise for ensuring food security and for producing biopharmaceuticals in plants. However, this engineering requires thorough knowledge of cis-regulatory elements to precisely control either endogenous or introduced genes. To generate this knowledge, we used a massively parallel reporter assay to measure the activity of nearly complete sets of promoters from Arabidopsis, maize and sorghum. We demonstrate that core promoter elements—notably the {TATA} box—as well as promoter {GC} content and promoter-proximal transcription factor binding sites influence promoter strength. By performing the experiments in two assay systems, leaves of the dicot tobacco and protoplasts of the monocot maize, we detect species-specific differences in the contributions of {GC} content and transcription factors to promoter strength. Using these observations, we built computational models to predict promoter strength in both assay systems, allowing us to design highly active promoters comparable in activity to the viral 35S minimal promoter. Our results establish a promising experimental approach to optimize native promoter elements and generate synthetic ones with desirable features.},

Dimerization of {BASIC} {LEUCINE} {ZIPPER} ({bZIP}) {TFs} are critical for their functions, but the molecular mechanism underlying the {DNA} binding and functional specificity of homo- versus heterodimers remains elusive. To address this gap, we present the double {DNA} Affinity Purification-sequencing ({dDAP}-seq) technique that maps heterodimer binding sites on endogenous genomic {DNA}. Using {dDAP}-seq we profile twenty pairs of C/S1 {bZIP} heterodimers and S1 homodimers in Arabidopsis and show that heterodimerization significantly expands the {DNA} binding preferences of these {TFs}. Analysis of {dDAP}-seq binding sites reveals the function of {bZIP}9 in abscisic acid response and the role of {bZIP}53 heterodimer-specific binding in seed maturation. The C/S1 heterodimers show distinct preferences for the {ACGT} elements recognized by plant {bZIPs} and motifs resembling the yeast {GCN}4 cis-elements. This study demonstrates the potential of {dDAP}-seq in deciphering the {DNA} binding specificities of interacting {TFs} that are key for combinatorial gene regulation.},

	abstract = {C. elegans develops through four larval stages that are rhythmically terminated by molts, that is, the synthesis and shedding of a cuticular exoskeleton. Each larval cycle involves rhythmic accumulation of thousands of transcripts, which we show here relies on rhythmic transcription. To uncover the responsible gene regulatory networks ({GRNs}), we screened for transcription factors that promote progression through the larval stages and identified {GRH}‐1, {BLMP}‐1, {NHR}‐23, {NHR}‐25, {MYRF}‐1, and {BED}‐3. We further characterize {GRH}‐1, a Grainyhead/{LSF} transcription factor, whose orthologues in other animals are key epithelial cell‐fate regulators. We find that {GRH}‐1 depletion extends molt durations, impairs cuticle integrity and shedding, and causes larval death. {GRH}‐1 is required for, and accumulates prior to, each molt, and preferentially binds to the promoters of genes expressed during this time window. Binding to the promoters of additional genes identified in our screen furthermore suggests that we have identified components of a core molting‐clock {GRN}. Since the mammalian orthologues of {GRH}‐1, {BLMP}‐1 and {NHR}‐23, have been implicated in rhythmic homeostatic skin regeneration in mouse, the mechanisms underlying rhythmic C. elegans molting may apply beyond nematodes.},

Here, we combined subcellular transcriptomics and massively parallel reporter assays and tested ∼50 000 sequences for their ability to localize to neurites. Mapping the localization potential of \&gt;300 genes revealed two ways neurite targeting can be achieved: focused localization motifs and broadly encoded localization potential. We characterized the interplay between {RNA} stability and localization and identified motifs able to bias localization towards neurite or soma as well as the trans-acting factors required for their action. Based on our data, we devised machine learning models that were able to predict the localization behavior of novel reporter sequences. Testing this predictor on native {mRNA} sequencing data showed good agreement between predicted and observed localization potential, suggesting that the rules uncovered by our {MPRA} also apply to the localization of native full-length transcripts.},

These small disc-shaped animals not only have nine morphologically described cell types and no neurons but also show coordinated behaviors triggered by peptide-secreting cells. We investigated possible neuronal affinities of these peptidergic cells using phylogenetics, chromatin profiling, and comparative single-cell genomics in four placozoans. We found conserved cell type expression programs across placozoans, including populations of transdifferentiating and cycling cells, suggestive of active cell type homeostasis. We also uncovered fourteen peptidergic cell types expressing neuronal-associated components like the pre-synaptic scaffold that derive from progenitor cells with neurogenesis signatures. In contrast, earlier-branching animals like sponges and ctenophores lacked this conserved expression. Our findings indicate that key neuronal developmental and effector gene modules evolved before the advent of cnidarian/bilaterian neurons in the context of paracrine cell signaling.,

Here, we developed {CoLa}-seq (co-transcriptional lariat sequencing) to investigate the timing and determinants of co-transcriptional splicing genome wide. Unexpectedly, 90\% of all introns, including long introns, can splice before transcription of a downstream exon, indicating that exon definition is not obligatory for most human introns. Still, splicing timing varies dramatically across introns, and various genetic elements determine this variation. Strong U2AF2 binding to the polypyrimidine tract predicts early splicing, explaining exon definition-independent splicing. Together, our findings question the essentiality of exon definition and reveal features beyond intron and exon length that are determinative for splicing timing., Zeng et al. report the timing of co-transcriptional splicing for tens of thousands of human introns, revealing that splicing timing varies dramatically across introns and early splicing occurs before transcription of a downstream 5′ splice site. Such variation in splicing timing is dependent on multiple genetic elements, including U2AF2 binding.,},

How their expression is regulated to control {tRNA} repertoires is unknown. Here we combined quantitative {tRNA} profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing to measure {tRNA} expression following the differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells into neuronal and cardiac cells. We find that {tRNA} transcript levels vary substantially, whereas {tRNA} anticodon pools, which govern decoding rates, are more stable among cell types. Mechanistically, {RNA} polymerase {III} transcribes a wide range of {tRNA} genes in human induced pluripotent stem cells but on differentiation becomes constrained to a subset we define as housekeeping {tRNAs}. This shift is mediated by decreased {mTORC}1 signalling, which activates the {RNA} polymerase {III} repressor {MAF}1. Our data explain how {tRNA} anticodon pools are buffered to maintain decoding speed across cell types and reveal that {mTORC}1 drives selective {tRNA} expression during differentiation.},
